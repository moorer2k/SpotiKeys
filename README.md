Tired of hunting for a straightforward tool to assign global hotkeys for controlling Spotify? Look no furtherâ€”this is your solution. Importantly, it operates without using the Spotify API, allowing even free users to take advantage of it.

Customize your hotkeys easily by editing the Hotkeys.txt file. If you're uncertain about which key values to use, consult the HotKeyHelper for guidance.

Please note, for actions like Liking/Disliking tracks, the Spotify window will briefly come into focus before minimizing again. Just something to keep in mind. Also, there are a few bugs I need to workout with this functionality, but it'll get done soon. So don't worry!

Enjoy your enhanced Spotify experience!
